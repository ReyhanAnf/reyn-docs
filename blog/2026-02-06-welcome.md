Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to my personal documentation hub. This site serves as a central repository for my technical specifications, system architectures, and engineering thoughts.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is this?

This platform is built with **Docusaurus** and designed to be a living document of my projects. Here you will find:

- **Technical Blueprints:** Detailed breakdown of system architectures (like the Talents Mapping 2026 Transformation).
- **Project Documentation:** Functional specifications and user guides.
- **Engineering Blog:** Thoughts on software design, modular monoliths, and legacy system migrations.

## Navigation

- Check out the **[Talents Mapping Documentation](/docs/talents-mapping/overview)** for my latest ongoing work.
- Explore the **[Blog](/blog)** for recent updates.

Stay tuned for more updates!
